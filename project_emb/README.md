# Embedding Study on Fake News Generation
Project to study the differences on word embeddings and how effective they are on classification

- [Pipfile](./Pipfile) - file to specify python virtual environment using pipenv
- [src/nn_bow.py](./src/nn_bow.py) - 41 lines of code. Definition of simple fully connected neural network using bag of words
- [src/helper/bow_model.py](./src/helper/bow_model.py) - 144 lines of code. Base class model to have been used for all bag of words models.

Note that this project was unfinished, yet the neural network should work and train off of the data.
